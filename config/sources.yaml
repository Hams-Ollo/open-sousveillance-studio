# Sources are organized by TIER (scope) to help prioritize and understand

      CivicClerk is a React SPA hosted at {site_id}.portal.civicclerk.com

      Page Structure:
      - Calendar widget (left) + Event list (right)
      - Scroll UP for past events, DOWN for future events
      - Each event has download button with 4 options

      Scraping Strategy:
      1. Load page with Firecrawl (wait 4s for React)
      2. Scroll to load past/future events
      3. Parse meeting list from markdown
      4. For each meeting with documents, download Agenda Packet (PDF)
      5. Process PDFs with Docling/Gemini

      Download Priority:
      - Agenda Packet (PDF) > Agenda (PDF) > Plain Text versions
      - Packets include staff reports, attachments, backup materials

      Known Issues:
      - Direct PDF URLs not exposed in HTML - require click interaction
      - May need Playwright for reliable PDF downloads
      - Future events have no documents until agenda is posted
