**Version:** 0.1.0-dev
**Status:** ✅ Core Agents Working
**Origin:** 📍 Alachua County, Florida

> *"Sousveillance"* (French: sous "from below" + veillance "watching") — the recording of an activity by a participant, in contrast to surveillance. **They watched us. Now we watch back.**

## What Is This?

Open Sousveillance Studio is an **open-source AI agent platform** that monitors local government activity and alerts citizens to important developments.

**The Problem:** Local government decisions happen fast. Agendas are posted days before meetings. Permit applications are buried in obscure portals. By the time citizens learn about a development threatening their water supply, it's often too late.

**The Solution:** AI agents that automatically watch government portals, extract actionable intelligence, and generate reports for community distribution.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Automated Monitoring** — Scouts watch 15+ government data sources daily
- 🧠 **AI Analysis** — Gemini 2.5 Pro extracts insights from meeting agendas and permits
- 🚨 **Smart Alerts** — RED/YELLOW/GREEN urgency levels for time-sensitive items
- 📊 **Structured Reports** — JSON output ready for dashboards or newsletters
- 🔧 **Dev Console** — Streamlit UI for testing and debugging

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- API Keys: [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com), [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev), [Tavily](https://tavily.com)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/open-sousveillance-studio.git
cd open-sousveillance-studio

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Run the Dev Console

The easiest way to test the system:

```bash
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
# Opens at http://localhost:8501
```

### Run the API Server

```bash
uvicorn src.app:app --reload --port 8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Configuration

Customize for your community by editing YAML files in `config/`:

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `instance.yaml` | Your deployment identity, timezone, schedules |
| `sources.yaml` | Government portals to monitor |
| `entities.yaml` | Projects, organizations, and keywords to watch |

Example watchlist entry:

```yaml
# config/entities.yaml
projects:
  - id: "tara-portfolio"
    name: "Tara Development Portfolio"
    urgency: "red"
    keywords: ["Mill Creek", "PSE22-0002"]
```
