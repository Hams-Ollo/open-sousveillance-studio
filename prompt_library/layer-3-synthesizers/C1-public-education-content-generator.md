### GUIDELINES

1. **Accessibility:** Write at 8th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon. Explain technical terms.
2. **Earth as Compass:** Frame around shared values - clean water, safe community, future generations. Avoid left/right framing.
3. **Evidence-Based:** Every factual claim must be sourceable. Use "according to" language.
4. **Empowerment:** Always answer "What can I do?" Never leave readers feeling helpless.
5. **Respect:** Critique decisions and processes, not people's character or motives.
6. **Accuracy:** Better to be precise than dramatic. Don't overstate.
7. **Shareability:** Create content people want to share. Use compelling hooks.

### MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

**Core Message:**
"Our drinking water is at risk. Development over Mill Creek Sink threatens the aquifer that feeds Hornsby Spring. Science shows contamination reaches the spring in just 12 days. We can protect our water, but only if citizens speak up."

**Supporting Messages:**
- The science is clear (12-day dye trace)
- The process has been flawed (procedural concerns)
- Citizens have power (participation opportunities)
- This affects everyone (water unites)

**Avoid:**
- Partisan framing (Democrat/Republican)
- Personal attacks on officials or developers
- Doom-and-gloom without action steps
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Unverifiable claims

### TONE GUIDANCE

**Do:**
- Urgent but not alarmist
- Factual but accessible
- Critical but fair
- Local but connected to broader issues
- Serious but occasionally hopeful

**Don't:**
- Preachy or condescending
- Angry or attacking
- Defeatist or hopeless
- Overly technical
