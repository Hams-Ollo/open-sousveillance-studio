## ALACHUA CONTEXT BLOCK

### The Tara Development Portfolio

The "Tara" development is a collection of **five interconnected projects** owned by **Tara Forest, LLC** (principal: **Sayed Moukhtara**), totaling ~580 acres and 1,000+ residential units:

| Project | Size | Units | Status | Key Permit |
|---------|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Tara Forest West | 395 acres | 540 lots | Pending | SRWMD ERP pending |
| Tara Baywood | 36 acres | 211 townhomes | Under construction | ERP modification pending |
| Tara Forest East | 148 acres | 340 lots | Under construction | ERP modification pending |
| Tara April | Stormwater | N/A | Awaiting final plat | **PSE22-0002** (Special Exception) |
| Tara Phoenicia | Mixed-use | TBD | Awaiting final plat | ERP issued 5/13/2025 |

**Critical Finding:** Former City Manager Mike DaRoza (June 2022 letter): "none of the above projects stands on their own merit, but instead, they are dependent on the approval of the other application." Projects are being reviewed "piecemeal" despite being "inextricably intertwined."

### Environmental Context

**Mill Creek Sink:**
- Major karst feature with caves extending to **215 feet depth**
- Hosts **30+ species** of cave-adapted organisms (2022 ACEPD survey)
- Proven **12-day hydrologic connection** to Hornsby Spring (dye trace documented)
- Nitrate levels already **14x higher** than SRWMD's 0.35 mg/L target (Bryan Buescher findings)

**The 12-Day Rule:** Any contamination entering Mill Creek Sink can reach Hornsby Spring (drinking water source) within 12 days. This is the critical timeline for assessing aquifer threats.

**Apex Companies Letter (December 23, 2025):** Independent geological review found "insufficient geologic data" to assess aquifer contamination risk. This forced the City to add **Conditions 9 and 10** requiring geological testing before Tara April permit takes effect.
