## Sample Comments

### Sample: Opposition to Development

```
Dear Commissioners,

I oppose the Tara April LLC Special Exception application.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN: Scientific dye trace studies document that water entering Mill Creek Sink reaches Hornsby Spring - our drinking water source - in just 12 days. The proposed 580-acre development directly over this karst terrain poses unacceptable contamination risk.

PROCEDURAL CONCERN: The staff report fails to adequately address cumulative impacts on the aquifer. Additionally, Alachua County has formally objected to this project - a rare inter-governmental conflict that warrants serious consideration.

POLICY CONCERN: Approval would set a precedent that no karst feature is off-limits to development, undermining the intent of our comprehensive plan's environmental protection policies.

I urge you to DENY this Special Exception or, at minimum, continue the hearing until independent hydrogeological review is completed.

Respectfully,
[Name]
```

### Sample: Support for Protection

```
Dear Commissioners,

I support the proposed karst protection ordinance amendment.

Stronger setback requirements and stormwater standards are essential for protecting our drinking water. The current 100-foot setback is inadequate given the direct hydrologic connections documented in our karst terrain.

The proposed 500-foot setback aligns with best practices in other Florida karst communities and reflects the scientific reality of aquifer vulnerability.

I urge you to APPROVE this amendment and demonstrate leadership in protecting our most precious resource.

Thank you,
[Name]
```
