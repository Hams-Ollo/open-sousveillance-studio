# Standard Report Output Template

**Purpose:** Consistent format for all intelligence reports  
**Usage:** Reference when reviewing AI outputs for format compliance

---

## YAML Frontmatter

All reports should begin with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
report_type: [meeting-intelligence|permit-intelligence|legislative-intelligence|network-intelligence|impact-assessment|procedural-integrity|public-education-content|strategic-campaign-plan|democratic-health-scorecard|annual-review-forecast]
agent: [A1|A2|A3|A4|B1|B2|C1|C2|C3|C4]-[agent-name]
date_generated: YYYY-MM-DD
period_covered: [DATE RANGE or WEEK NUMBER or MONTH or QUARTER]
jurisdiction: City of Alachua, Alachua County
urgency_level: [RED|YELLOW|GREEN]
---
```

---

## Standard Sections

### 1. Header Block

```markdown
# [Report Title]

**Generated:** [DATE]  
**Period:** [COVERAGE PERIOD]  
**Agent:** [AGENT ID AND NAME]
```

### 2. Executive Summary

Always include a 2-5 sentence executive summary immediately after the header. This should answer: "What does a busy citizen need to know RIGHT NOW?"

### 3. Urgency Alerts

Use consistent color coding:

```markdown
## Urgency Alerts

### RED - Immediate Action Required
[Items requiring action within 48 hours]

### YELLOW - Monitor Closely
[Items requiring attention within 7-14 days]

### GREEN - Routine Monitoring
[Standard items, no immediate concern]
```

### 4. Main Content Sections

Organize with clear headers (##, ###) and use tables for structured data:

```markdown
## [Section Title]

### [Subsection]

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data | Data | Data |
```

### 5. Action Items

Always end with specific, actionable items:

```markdown
## Action Items for Citizens

- [ ] [Specific action with deadline]
- [ ] [Specific action with deadline]
- [ ] [Specific action with deadline]
```

### 6. Information Gaps

Document what could not be found:

```markdown
## Information Gaps

[Note any information that could not be found - may require public records request]
```

### 7. Sources

Cite all sources:

```markdown
## Sources Consulted

- [URL or Document Name] - accessed [date]
- [URL or Document Name] - accessed [date]
```

### 8. Footer

```markdown
---
*Report generated by [AGENT-ID]-[Agent-Name]*
*Alachua Civic Intelligence System*
```

---

## Formatting Standards

### Dates
- Use ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Week numbers: YYYY-WXX (e.g., 2026-W03)
- Quarters: YYYY-QX (e.g., 2026-Q1)

### Urgency Levels

| Level | Meaning | Timeframe |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| RED | Immediate action required | Within 48 hours |
| YELLOW | Monitor closely | Within 7-14 days |
| GREEN | Routine monitoring | No immediate deadline |

### Tables
- Use markdown tables for structured data
- Keep columns aligned
- Include headers

### Lists
- Use bullet points (-) for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists (1.) for sequential items
- Use checkboxes (- [ ]) for action items

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key terms and important information
- *Italic* for document titles and emphasis
- `Code` for technical terms, URLs, file names

### Citations
- Link to primary sources when possible
- Note access date for web sources
- Use "according to [source]" language
