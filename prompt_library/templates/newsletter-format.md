## This Week's Big Story

The Tara development hearing is finally here. After months of preparation, the City Commission will vote Monday night on the Special Exception that would allow 1,000+ homes to be built directly adjacent to Mill Creek Sink.

This is the moment we've been preparing for. Your voice matters.

## Quick Hits

- **Tara Hearing:** Monday, January 20, 6pm, City Hall
- **County Objects:** Alachua County formally opposed the project (rare!)
- **Comment Deadline:** Written comments due by 5pm Monday

## The Tara Decision: What You Need to Know

After two years of applications, studies, and public meetings, the Tara April LLC development comes down to a single vote Monday night.

### The Stakes

If approved, this 580-acre project would place over 1,000 homes directly over the karst terrain that feeds our drinking water. Scientific dye trace studies prove that water entering Mill Creek Sink reaches Hornsby Spring in just 12 days.

That's not a theory. That's documented fact.

### What the County Said

In a rare move, Alachua County formally objected to the project, citing concerns about:
- Inadequate environmental review
- Stormwater system design inappropriate for karst
- Cumulative impacts on the aquifer

When the County objects to a City project, it's worth paying attention.
