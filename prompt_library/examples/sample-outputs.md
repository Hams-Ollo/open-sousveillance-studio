# Strategic Impact Assessment Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-20  
**Week:** Week 3 (January 13-19, 2026)  
**Analyst:** B1-Impact-Assessment-Analyst

## Executive Summary

Critical week for aquifer protection. Tara Special Exception hearing Monday will determine fate of 580 acres over Mill Creek Sink. County's formal objection strengthens opposition case but City staff still recommends approval. Cumulative development pressure in karst areas continues to escalate.

## Overall Threat Level: RED

**Rationale:** Imminent decision on largest development threat to aquifer. Approval would set precedent for karst development.

## Environmental Impact Assessment

### Aquifer and Water Quality

**Current Threat Level:** RED

**Key Findings:**
- Tara project would place 1000+ units over direct aquifer recharge area
- 12-day travel time from Mill Creek Sink to Hornsby Spring means contamination impacts are rapid
- Proposed stormwater system relies on infiltration - inappropriate for karst

**12-Day Rule Application:**
Any contamination from Tara site could reach drinking water supply within two weeks. No proposed mitigation adequately addresses this timeline.

### Cumulative Impervious Surface Analysis

**This Week's Additions:** 580 acres proposed (Tara)
**Other Pending in Karst:** ~120 acres (3 smaller projects)
**Cumulative Concern:** Total of 700+ acres of karst development pending

## Strategic Recommendations

### Highest Priority Threats

1. **Tara Special Exception (Monday)**
   - Why critical: Largest single threat; sets precedent
   - Recommended action: Maximum turnout, coordinate testimony
   - Deadline: January 20, 6pm

### Leverage Points for Intervention

- County objection provides political cover for denial
- Staff conditions are inadequate - push for stronger conditions if approval likely
- Build record for appeal regardless of outcome

### THE VOTE THAT WILL DEFINE OUR WATER'S FUTURE

**Monday night, everything changes.**

After two years of applications, studies, and public meetings, the Tara development comes down to a single vote. Five commissioners. One decision. Our drinking water hanging in the balance.

Here's what you need to know.

**The Project**

Tara April LLC wants to build over 1,000 homes on 580 acres directly adjacent to Mill Creek Sink. That's the sinkhole that connects - in just 12 days - to Hornsby Spring, where we get our drinking water.

This isn't speculation. Scientists proved it with dye trace studies. Pour something into Mill Creek Sink, and it shows up at Hornsby Spring less than two weeks later.

**The County Said No**

Last week, something remarkable happened. Alachua County formally objected to the Tara project. That almost never happens - one government telling another "we think you're making a mistake."

The County's concerns? Inadequate environmental review. Stormwater systems designed for normal terrain, not karst. Cumulative impacts on the aquifer that no one is tracking.

**What You Can Do**

Your voice matters. Here's how to use it:

1. **Submit a written comment** by 5pm Monday to citycommission@cityofalachua.com
2. **Show up** at City Hall at 6pm Monday
3. **Sign up to speak** - arrive by 5:45pm
4. **Wear blue** - let's fill the room with water protectors

**The Bottom Line**

This vote will echo for generations. The aquifer doesn't care about politics. The springs don't negotiate. Once contaminated, our water can't be uncontaminated.

Monday night, we find out what kind of community we want to be.

See you at City Hall.
